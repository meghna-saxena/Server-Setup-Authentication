# Server-Setup-Authentication

### Goal -
Build an API that can serve data to authenticated users. The server can be used for any application and not just react app.

### Key Points -
- Exchange username(email) or password for some identifying piece of info., JWT token.
- Client uses that token for all future requests that need to be authenticated.
- Used manually wired-up token instead of cokkies since they can be set to any domain.
